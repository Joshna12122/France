we have made this website to make awareness about other cultures, and how the 
audience should show respect and show cultural appreciation to people from 
different cultures. we want to make a website that has fewer weaknesses, and has 
a lot of strengths, So we will make a website that will not only educate their 
peers but also the wider school community and parents. This product has to 
include the culture's rich history, unique traditions, art, music, dance, and 
cuisine, but it is not widely known or understood by most students at my school 
or other schools, or places.</p>
